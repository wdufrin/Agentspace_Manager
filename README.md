# Gemini Enterprise Manager

A web interface to manage Google Cloud Gemini Enterprise resources, including agents, authorizations, and reasoning engines. This UI provides a user-friendly way to perform operations similar to the `gcloud` CLI tool for Gemini Enterprise. It includes a guided setup process to validate and enable necessary Google Cloud APIs, making project configuration straightforward.

This application is built using React and communicates with Google Cloud APIs via the **Google API JavaScript Client (`gapi`)**.

## Key Features

-   **Manage Agents**: List, create, update, delete, enable/disable, and chat with agents.
-   **Manage Authorizations**: List, create, update, and delete OAuth client authorizations.
-   **Manage Reasoning Engines**: List engines, view agent dependencies, and delete unused engines.
-   **Explore Data Stores**: List data stores within a collection, view their details, and inspect individual documents and their content.
-   **Model Armor Log Viewer**: Fetch and inspect safety policy violation logs from Cloud Logging.
-   **Comprehensive Backup & Restore**: Backup and restore agents, assistants, data stores, authorizations, and entire Discovery Engine configurations.
-   **Guided Setup & API Validation**: An initial setup screen that validates if all required GCP APIs are enabled for your project and provides a one-click solution to enable any that are missing.

### Beta Features

-   **Architecture Visualizer**: Scans your project to discover all Gemini Enterprise resources and renders an interactive, top-down graph of their relationships and dependencies.
-   **Chat**: A dedicated, full-page interface for chatting with any of your registered agents.
-   **Agent Builder**: A powerful UI to construct ADK-based agents from scratch. It automatically generates the necessary Python code (`agent.py`), environment (`.env`), and dependency (`requirements.txt`) files. Features include:
    -   A tool builder for easily adding Vertex AI Search tools.
    -   Options to download the complete agent code as a `.zip` file.
    -   An integrated uploader to stage agent files (`agent.pkl` and `requirements.txt`) directly to a GCS bucket.
    -   A deployment wizard to deploy the staged agent to a new or existing Reasoning Engine.
-   **A2A Function Builder**: A tool to generate the source code (`main.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`) for a secure, serverless A2A (Agent-to-Agent) function on Cloud Run.
-   **Agent Registration**: A guided UI to register a deployed A2A function with a Gemini Enterprise Engine, making it discoverable as a tool.
-   **A2A Tester**: A simple utility to test the discovery endpoint (`agent.json`) of a deployed A2A function.
-   **Explore MCP Servers**: Scan for Cloud Run services in a specified region. Identifies potential MCP servers if a service's labels contain "MCP". Provides a detailed view of each service's configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before using this application, ensure you have the following:

1.  **A Google Cloud Project**: Your resources will be managed within a specific GCP project.
2.  **Enabled APIs**: Make sure the following APIs are enabled for your project:
    -   Discovery Engine API
    -   AI Platform (Vertex AI) API
    -   Cloud Resource Manager API
    -   Cloud Logging API
    -   Cloud Run Admin API
    -   Cloud Storage API
    -   Service Usage API
3.  **`gcloud` CLI**: You need the Google Cloud CLI installed and authenticated to obtain an access token.
4.  **Access Token**: Generate a temporary access token by running the following command in your terminal:
    ```sh
    gcloud auth print-access-token
    ```

## How to Run

This method is recommended for development and uses the standard Node.js ecosystem.

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the Development Server**: Once installation is complete, start the server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will launch a development server and should automatically open the application in your default browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000` or a similar address).
3.  **Configure the App**:
    -   Paste the access token generated from the `gcloud` command into the **"Paste GCP Access Token"** field.
    -   Follow the on-screen instructions to set your GCP Project ID/Number and validate/enable the required APIs.
4.  **Ready to Use**: You can now use the application to manage your Gemini Enterprise resources.

## Underlying Google Cloud APIs

While the application uses the Google API JavaScript Client (`gapi`) for all interactions, the following `curl` examples illustrate the underlying REST API calls for each major feature. This is useful for reference, testing, and understanding the raw API endpoints.

You will need to replace placeholders like `[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]` and `[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN]` with your own values.

### List of APIs Used

The application interacts with the following Google Cloud APIs, using their respective discovery documents for client library initialization:

-   [Gemini Enterprise API (v1alpha)](https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1alpha)
-   [Gemini Enterprise API (v1beta)](https://discoveryengine.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1beta)

**Register an A2A Agent:** Creates a new agent resource from a deployed Cloud Run function.

```sh
# The 'jsonAgentCard' is a stringified JSON object.
curl -X POST \

**Test an A2A Agent (Discovery):** Fetches the `agent.json` discovery file from a deployed A2A function. **Note:** This requires an **Identity Token**, not an Access Token.

```sh
# Generate the Identity Token and make the request in one command
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token --audience https://[YOUR_SERVICE_URL].run.app)" \
  "https://[YOUR_SERVICE_URL].run.app/.well-known/agent.json"
```

#### **Backup & Recovery Tab**

This feature orchestrates a series of `list` and `get` calls (like the examples above) to build a comprehensive backup of all specified resources. The restore process uses corresponding `create` calls to rebuild the resources from the backup file.
